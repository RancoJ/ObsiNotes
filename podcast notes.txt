Alzheimer¡¦s disease are mostly preventable, only 5% are triggered by genetics.

It develops in 30s and symptoms shows up in 60s ¡V 70s.

Higher VO2Max have greater ¡§reserve¡¨ to overcome stress.

Higher cognitive capacity can protect the brain later in life from harmful insults like toxic protein build-ups, small strokes, inflammation, and age-related cell loss.  This means symptoms may appear later or be less severe, even when brain damage is present.

Huntington¡¦s disease is a rare, inherited brain disorder that causes progressive loss of movement control, thinking, and emotional regulation. It is caused by a faulty gene that leads to toxic protein build-up in brain cells, which gradually die over time.

Higher cognitive capacity means more brain connections.

Novelty builds brain connections.

Brain connections will fail over time, when you don¡¦t use them.

Preserve brain connections: Exercise, Reading and handwriting. Resistance training has the best result.

The APOE e4 gene increases Alzheimer¡¦s risk because it makes the brain less efficient at clearing harmful proteins like amyloid. This leads to greater protein build-up, more inflammation and reduced repair of brain cells over time.

A UK twin study found that leg power predicts cognitive ageing, despite controlling the common genetics and early life environment shared by twins, interventions targeted to improve leg power may help reach a universal goal of healthy cognitive ageing.

The one-repetition max (1RM) is the maximum amount of weight you can lift once with proper form. For example, if your bench press 1RM is 100kg, you would need to lift 80kg in your sets, for the neural benefits.

High IL-6 levels are linked to cancer growth, however, exercise-induced IL-6, released by the muscles, reduces inflammation, improves insulin sensitivity, and slows tumour growth. Short-term IL-6 spikes from exercise are beneficial, while chronically high IL-6 levels are harmful.

Air squat 10 times every hour for 8 times, can offset 30mins (running ?)

Lactate threshold is the point during exercise when lactate begins to accumulate in the bloodstream faster than It can be cleared. It¡¦s often used as an indicator of endurance ¡V higher lactate thresholds typically indicate better aerobic capacity, meaning you are fitter.

BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) is a protein that supports the growth and maintenance of brain cells (neurons). It also helps with neuroplasticity, the brain¡¦s ability to forming new neural connections and adapt to new experiences.

Increasing VO2Max:
The Norwegian 4x4 is 4-minute intervals of intense exercise at 90-95% of maximum effort, followed by 3-4 minutes of rest. The workout is typically repeated 4 times, and improves endurance and aerobic capacity.

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a protective layer of cells around the brain¡¦s blood vessels. It controls what substances can pass from the blood into the brain, ensuring harmful substances are blocked and necessary nutrients can enter, keeping the brain safe.

Dementia is the leading cause of death for women in the UK, a position it has held consistently since 2011. It has also become the leading cause of death in Australia, overtaking heart disease. In the US, it is ranked the 6th leading cause of death.

The keto diet is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that aims to shift the body¡¦s metabolism into ketosis, where it burns fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates. The diet is often used for weight loss, but it may also have benefits fro certain medical conditions like epilepsy.

The myelin sheath is a specialized, fatty insulating layer that wraps around the axons (nerve fibers) of neurons. It acts as a protective, accelerating layer that allows electrical impulses to travel rapidly and efficiently between neurons.

During perimenopause, lower estrogen levels make it harder for the brain to use glucose for energy, creating and ¡§energy gap¡¨. This can lead to brain fog, fatigue, and memory problems, as the brain struggles to get the energy it needs, even with sufficient food intake.

Findings on the effects of menopausal hormone therapy on Alzheimer¡¦s disease and dementia risk vary depending on the timing of initiation, hormone formulation, and study design. Further research is needed to clarify these relationships.

Tau protein helps stabilize microtubules in brain cells, supporting cell structure and nutrient transport. In Alzheimer¡¦s, tau becomes abnormal and forms tangles, disrupting brain cell function and contributing to memory loss and cognitive decline.

Supplements Gaba helps stabilize the mind to allow getting to sleep.

Lower body temperature is required for sleep. Supplementing Glycin also helps, it also has benefits of improving longevity. Ashwaganda helps with stress

[1:12:30] benefits of omega-3
Omega-3 pills may be oxidized, look for suppliers highly creditble and certified

Vitamin D

[1:15:43] Creatine benefits

Look for suppliers have A) NFA certified B) is it pure (texture: gritty).


The NHANES 2025 study involved over 25,000 adults and found a linear negative association between creatine intake and cancer prevalence. For each 1-standard-deviation increase in dietary creatine intake, the odds of having cancer decreases by about 5%

Test and training for brain cognitive performance:
1.	Read colour or text only.
2.	Tennis ball & eye patch

Doing hard things increases cognitive function over lifespan
